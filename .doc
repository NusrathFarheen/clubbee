📚 Campus Club Management Suite
1. Overview
The Campus Club Management Suite is a web-based platform that digitizes student club operations and fosters inter-college collaboration.
It enables students to create and manage clubs, organize events, publish achievements, and interact with like-minded peers.
This project is being developed for a hackathon, focusing on fast prototyping while demonstrating innovation, tech implementation, and usability.

2. Problem Statement
Currently, student clubs face challenges such as:
•	Lack of digital tools for managing members and events
